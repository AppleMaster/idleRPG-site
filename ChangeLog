This is the ChangeLog for the Idle RPG Website Code. I'm not as religious about
making sure my updates make it here as I am about changes to the IRPG code
making it into that ChangeLog, so there may be changes between versions that you
don't see listed here.

Also, please note that any use of "incowrect" or other cow-related "typos" are
NOT typos. I like cattle. A lot. Please stop fixing them :^)

    * huge modification of the entire source by the original coder, res0
      <bk@slashnet.org>. res0 has really helped this project through his many
      contributions; it wouldn't be where it is today without him. thanks, res0!
      * New site layout (valid XHTML 1.1 strict) using CSS
      * Cleaned up PHP
      * User maps do not display unless visitor clicks 'display' link
    * changed fgets() calls to add the optional second parameter (for old PHPs)
    * removed incorrect header() in makequestmap() (mikegrb)
    * checked to make sure key $_SESSION['time'] was set before attempting to
      reference it (HarK0nNeN)
    * db.php's table tag now specifies the number of rows and columns to make
      drawing faster in browsers that pay attention to it (res0)
    * header("Location: ") directives now give full URIs
    * made better use of htmlentities() and urlencode()s as relates to display
      of usernames and classes
    * users on quest and world maps are now clickable, leading to their player
      info page (John Nielsen)

2004-05-31  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@idlerpg.net>
    * changed players.php to show offline users as gray, this style is in
      header.php, patch from Chewie <chewie@f2o.org>
    * changed map-drawing PHP scripts to draw a transparent image which is then
      overlayed (using CSS) over the static newmap.png image. changed the map
      drawing frequency to 1/user/20s as I think this greatly decreases CPU
      usage. changed the maperror.png to something more appropriate. $mapx
      and $mapy in config.php describe the dimensions of your map file (Rick)
    * fixed quest.php to show proper coordinates; another evil c/p error (Rick)

2004-05-23  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@idlerpg.net>
    * changed most everything to make sense with the new database
    * edited dump.php to display data in the same format, despite the new
      database format. 
    * added an xml.php page that takes a 'player' argument and displays
      information on that user in xml 1.0 format. should allow a better API
      as far as compatibility with newer dbs goes
    * changed playerview.php to use fgets() to read from modifiers.txt.
      hopefully this is much faster
    * edited playerview.php to show map and XML data link
    * changed the counter in footer.php to strip the leading path information
      from $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] before using it to identify the page
    * removed some unused $i variable from players.php
    * created quest.php which shows active quest info
    * created makequestmap.php which draws a quest map if quest type is 2,
      redirects otherwise
    * created worldmap.php which shows the active state of the irpg world
    * created makeworldmap.php which draws the world map
    * created makemap.php which takes a 'player' argument and draws them on the
      map
    * commonfunctions.php now has functions to sort by isadmin flag and player
      alignment
    * index.php updated with information on the new game features
    * changed titles on several pages to use $irpg_chan instead of hard-coded
      #G7
    * updated header.php to link to new pages and idlerpg.net forum
    * changed 'time modifiers' to 'character modifiers' as item modifiers are
      now stored, also

2004-05-23  Alexander Hirzel  <chewie@f2o.org>
    * submitted a series of patches to correct, among other things, the horrible
      use of <td> where <th> was more appropriate

2004-04-22  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@idlerpg.net>
	* if $_GET['alltime'] wasn't set, < and > in time modifiers were not
	  translated to &lt; and &gt; (thanks DinTx)
	* attempted to fix playerview.php from showing others' stats, traded
	  stristr() for strstr() matching either "^name ", " name ", or "^name's "

2004-04-23  Jonathan Attwell <caffeen@caffeen.org>
	* created README, detailing how users are to install and what to edit.
	* created config.php, which holds all the setup variables.
	* cleaned up some of the php coding.

2004-04-15  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@ultrazone.org>
	* we now stripslashes() on $_GET['player'] for players.php,
	  playerview.php, dump.php (thanks Diab)

2004-04-05  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@ultrazone.org>
	* removed some of parallax's tabs :^)
	* edited players.php to forward requests for specific players to the proper
	  playerview.php
	* changed links in sitesource.php to be fully-qualified
	* removed preg_grep in playerview.php, which insecurely used tainted
	  data. switched to stristr. (thanks mike@ethernal.org)
	* stripped < and > from modifiers.txt output (thanks mike@ethernal.org)
	* changed link to idlerpg-adv.txt in players.php to be fully-qualified.
	  (thanks daxxar)
	* may've made other changes, not sure.

2004-02-15  Jon Honeycutt  <jotun@ultrazone.org>
	* edited source.php to provide fully-qualified URLs to source files;
	  easier for users to follow license.
	* playerview.php's 'View all Time Modifiers' link now displays the
	  number of time modifiers.
	* contact.php now sends a From: field in its headers parameter.

2004-01-31  Titus Barik  <titus@barik.net>
	* created ChangeLog, following Debian ChangeLog format.
	* modified header.php to be location independent via $BASE_URL var.
	* players.php and playerview.php are now separate files.
